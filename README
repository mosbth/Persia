1. Persia, Download
 
Persia is on GitHub.
 
  http://github.com/mosbth/Persia/
 
Dowload it and point browser to index.php. That should be enough.
 
An example of a pure standard installation of persia is available here. Review it before moving
on. Its actually my own development copy, so be ware, it may not always function as one might wish.
 
  http://www.phpersia.org/persia

There is currently no stable version of Persia. 

 
2. Persia, A template for websites
 
Persia is to be a complete and powerful webbtemplate with a minimum of code. A kind of CMS for developers.

It's an utopia. But who knows.

 
3. Persia lives?
 
Persia is my own project and is used in courses I conduct at Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden. 
It lives as long as its useful. No need for eternal life.
 
The course-blog is available here (pure swedish, use google translate...).
 
  http://db-o-webb.blogspot.com/
 
The course has a irc-channel. I'm in there.

4. Persia, The name
 
It must have a namn. Persia sounds nice. It has a history which can connect to this software project.
Persia has a little sister which is named Greco. Greco is for real small websites.
So, Persia and Greco. Thats their names.

  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greco-Persian_Wars
 
Its always a war between Greco and Persia on what funktionality should be in the more complete 
Persia and in the lighter variant Greco.
 
 
5. Persia, The attitude
 
One must have attitude. Or a philosophy. Perhaps like this?

That works for now.
